# smaths

This is a zero-dependency, minimal implementation of common maths formulas.

It is (currently) not written in a particularly FP style to make it as fast as possible.

Besides more useful formulas, the intention is to add a more FP wrapper and dependencies on common libraries. However, note that the "raw" implementations will always be available without these dependencies.
